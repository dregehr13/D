    <p>
        I want 413 to help me become a weapon. I took a year and a half break after the first semester of the junior core. I ended up working full time at a company I really like and am valued at.
        There are so many things I could do to improve the business if I had a better grasp on programming, both the critical thinking aspect of it as well as the hard skills associated with it. I believe I will bring
        much more valuable to the company after 413 and these other classes.
